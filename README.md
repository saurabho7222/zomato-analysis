**To address our analysis, we need to respond to the subsequent inquiries:**

- Do a greater number of restaurants provide online delivery as opposed to offline services
- Which types of restaurants are the most favored by the general public
- What price range is preferred by couples for their dinner at restaurants
- maximum votes to restaurant
- checking how many customers order online and offline

- Letâ€™s explore the approx_cost(for two people) column
- Now we will examine whether online orders receive higher ratings or offline orders.



CONCLUSION: Dining restaurants primarily accept offline orders, whereas cafes primarily receive
            online orders. This suggests that clients prefer to place orders in person at 
            restaurants, but prefer online ordering at cafes.
